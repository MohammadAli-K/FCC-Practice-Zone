# FCC-Practice-Zone

Welcome to my **FreeCodeCamp Practice Zone**! ðŸŽ¯

This is where I practice and experiment with what Iâ€™m learning from FreeCodeCamp â€” starting with HTML and CSS, and eventually moving into JavaScript and beyond.

### ðŸ’» What you'll find here:

- Mini projects (like landing pages, forms, and more)
- Code snippets for testing things like Flexbox or Grid
- Notes and cheat sheets for quick reference
- A whole bunch of learning and growth!

### ðŸš€ Why this exists:

Iâ€™m learning web development step by step, and this repo is my coding playground.  
Feel free to look around â€” just keep in mind, itâ€™s all a work in progress. ðŸ˜„
